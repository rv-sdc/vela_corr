Imaging of Vela Data

So far, we have got the dynamic spectra then dedispersed it and then got the pulses in time domain.
The code for this is "Vela_V1.py"

Vela_V1 takes raw data from an array. This array is created using "dataextract.py". It is used to reduce the run time.

edit "dataextract.py" with you directory before running it. 
The Raw data file is available on the drive shared by desh.
